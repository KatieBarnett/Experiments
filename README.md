# Experiments
Android development experiments, tutorials and demos.

## Notes for use
These are random things I have been working on for talks, tutorials and blog posts, I provide no guarantee that the code will always be working or is the best implementation of a specific thing. 

If you want to try them out, import the project from the top level as each 'experiement' is a module and some share common code.
